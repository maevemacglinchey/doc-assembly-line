# Variable/field names to use when editing fields in Adobe Acrobat or the Documate Field Renamer

Below is a list of names to use when renaming fields in your template, and suggestions for adding new ones.
The advantage of using the same names we picked out below is that we will able to write great, multi-lingual, plain-language
versions of all of the questions for the standard names, and we'll use those on all of the interviews.

The fields we picked out below will also be saved as default on the server, so that someone can re-use them on a different form. Often, 
one issue requires filling in 3-4 forms. This is an important time-saving feature.

Please contact us if you think we missed a commonly used field name that we should standardize.

In some cases, a single variable name below will also contain the power of multiple individual variables. For example, 
`user_address_on_one_line` will be the user's full address for you to place in a convenient location in the PDF, but the 
user will be prompted for it in parts.

Names communicate meaning. In PDF forms, every field needs a unique name. We will make use of those same names you use in the PDF in the 
Docassemble interviews that we create. They'll be referenced by coders, subject matter experts, and people who are reading the PDF form
and aren't experts in coding or in the applicable law. We need to choose names that communicate meaning to all of those different
participants in building this interview.

The most important thing to do when naming fields is to use names that help us communicate. They should be clear, concise, and 
consistent, both within a single form and from form to form.

Some rules for naming fields:

<!--
  What's the deal with is_parent_yes/no? That's not for a variable name,
  that's for a variable value
-->

## Naming conventions

* Please use all lowercase characters for all fields.
* Field names can only include letters, numbers, and underscores, and they _must_ start with a letter or underscore--not a number.
* Separate multiple words in a field name with an underscore.
* Keep the field names short, but descriptive. When you must choose between short length and clarity, choose clarity.
* Avoid acronyms and abbreviations, other than very common ones such as ID.
* When you have several **related variables** in a row, try to start the field name with the feature that groups them, for easy alphabetical sorting. E.g., asset_checking, asset_savings, etc.
* Use verb-noun pairs for **checkboxes**. E.g., is_parent, speaks_spanish, has_assets
* For **checkboxes** with a yes and no pair, add `_no` and `_yes` to the end. E.g., is_parent_yes and is_parent_no
* For **date variables** other than birthdate, end the question with `_date`. E.g., filedanswer_date
* If you need to refer to the **same field name more than once** in a single form, you will need to add two underscores followed by a number to distinguish them. E.g., user_name_full, user_name_full__1, user_name_full__2.
* Keep the **length of variable names** under 79 characters (unlikely you'll reach this limit, but just to be specific)
* For **questions with more than one line to write an answer**, use one field over the entire text block, rather than labelling each line as a separate field individually. 

This makes use of work at https://github.com/knod/docassemble-standards/wiki/Standardized-Definitions-For-Variable-Names, 
with some changes because we are using PDFs and not Word Documents.

## Information about people

We have 4 main groups of people:

1. the user, and possibly other users (user2, user3, etc.) representing co-parties (this is the person completing the form)
1. a child/children
1. the opposing party/parties
1. a witness(es)

<!--
This needs to be user tested to make sure people actually do this.
If they don't, we need to collect what names they do use for those fields.
Added it as an issue in SMEs board.
-->

You can use user2 for the spouse, etc.

## General notes

1. Alternatives: `user` and `user1` prefixes are treated the same way.
1. Pluralities: When signifying a second or third of anything, you
just increase the number in the prefix. For example, `user2` and `user3`.
1. If users or other_parties is an organization,
use the first_name field to store their full name.
1. Full names will be a combination of the other name parts. It's
built into docassemble as `str()`. For example, `str( users[0] )`.
1. The value of the `gender` text field will be, when needed,
sorted into "Other", "Female", and "Male". There will be a message
to the user letting them know that their custom entry will be used
wherever it's possible.
1. All the individuals can have the fields you see in the `users` fields.

<!-- Is `use_name_ful` something that a user would fill in? -->

Label to use in the PDF | internal Docassemble Variable Name
------------------------|-----------------------------------
`user_name_first` | `users[0].name.first`
`user_name_middle` | `users[0].name.middle`
`user_name_last` | `users[0].name.last`
`user_name_suffix` | `users[0].name.suffix`
`user_name_full` | `str(users[0])`
`user_gender` (text field) | `users[0].gender`

user1_name_first | users[0].name.first
... | ...
user2_name_first | users[1].name.first
... | ...

<!--
  Needed?
**Note** You can keep adding additional numbers to the user field name to get the same variables--including name, gender, address, etc., up to 10. That has effect of users[0], users[1], etc., but we'll only handle mapping to PDF up to 10.

### Court information

<!-- Should court have court_address_county to be consistent with the other fields? -->

Label to use in the PDF | internal Docassemble Variable Name
------------------------|-----------------------------------

court_county (note: in many forms, this says 'ss' where the county should go) | court.address.county
docket_number | docket_number

**Note**: just ignore/delete any drop-down menus for court name in existing court forms. We'll replace with the name of the
court, written out as a new field. You can likely cover up the field by setting a white background.

Below variables will be filled in to have the full name(s) of the various people who fill that role. 
E.g. you might have user/user2 both in the Plaintiff field. It would display as a list with a comma or 'and' in between each name.
E.g., Joe Smith and Jane Smith.

We will ask a question to determine which party is the plaintiff/defendant or petitioner/respondent.

This needs to be a **digital signature field**. This option is hidden in some versions of Acrobat.
